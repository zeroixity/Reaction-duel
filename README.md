# Reaction-duel
What is this game about?
-----------------------
This game is meant to test your reaction time, its a local co-op game where players simply wait for the visual cue "go" and then click whatever assigned keybind they have as fast 
as possible, you get 1 point if you win the round however if the "go" text is red and you click the button you will not get the point as this is a false win (can happen at random)
